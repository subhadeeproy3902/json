# Any Data to JSON Converter API

This API converts any input data into JSON format based on the format you specify. You can define the desired structure and data types for the output JSON by sending a POST request to the API.

## API Endpoint

**Base URL:**  
`https://json.mvp-subha.me/api/json`

## HTTP Method

`POST`

## Request Headers

- `Content-Type: application/json`

## Request Body Format

The request body should be in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "data": "<input data to convert>",
  "format": {
    "<key>": { "type": "<data type>" }
  }
}
```

## Parameters:

- `data` (string): The raw input data you want to convert.

- `format` (object): Defines the structure and types of the expected JSON output. The keys represent the desired JSON fields, and the `type` specifies the data type (e.g., `number`, `string`, `boolean`, etc.).

## Example Request Body

JavaScript (using fetch):

```javascript
await fetch("https://json.mvp-subha.me/api/json", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    data: "This phones battery life lasts a whole day!",
    format: {
      batteryLifeHrs: { type: "number" }
    },
  }),
})
```

cURL:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://json.mvp-subha.me/api/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "data": "This phones battery life lasts a whole day!",
  "format": {
    "batteryLifeHrs": { "type": "number" }
  }
}'
```

## Explanation:

In this example, the raw input data (`"This phones battery life lasts a whole day!"`) is converted to JSON format, where the field `batteryLifeHrs` is expected to be a number.

## Response

The API will return a JSON response in the format specified in the request.

## Example Response:

```json
{
  "batteryLifeHrs": 24
}
```

Here, the API extracted the value of the battery life from the text data and formatted it as a number.

## Error Handling

In case of an error (e.g., invalid input format or type mismatch), the API will return an error message in JSON format:

```json
{
  "error": "Invalid format or type"
}
```
